from NYC gallery and museum Instagram profiles — biographies and post captions.
Extract all upcoming NYC art gallery openings and exhibitions mentioned.

Rules:
- Create a SEPARATE entry for each distinct exhibition or opening event.
- Only extract events that are UPCOMING (future dates relative to today). Skip past events.
- Only extract events in NYC (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island).
- Set event_type = "art" always. Skip concerts, theater, comedy, film, and conferences.
- event_title format: "[Exhibition Name] at [Gallery]" — e.g. "Soft Machines at Gagosian"
  For a solo show: "[Artist Name]: [Show Title] at [Gallery]"
  For a group show with no distinct title: "Group Exhibition at [Gallery]"
- artist: the featured artist(s) name(s), comma-separated. For group shows use "Various Artists".
- venue: the gallery or museum name only — no city/state suffix.
- date: The OPENING date (or start date of the run) in "MM-DD-YYYY" format.
  If only a date range is shown (e.g. "June 5 – July 20"), use the start date.
- start_time: opening reception time if given, in "00:00am/pm" format (e.g. "06:00pm").
  Leave null if no specific reception time is listed.
- genre: assign exactly ONE from this list:
  Contemporary, Modern, Photography, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing, Mixed Media,
  Installation, Video Art, Performance, Printmaking, Ceramics, Textile, Street Art, Other.
- description: a 1-2 sentence description from the caption. Include medium, themes, or context.
- Populate no_tickets_source_1 with the Instagram profile URL.
- Populate no_tickets_webpage_contents_1 with the relevant post caption text.
- If exhibition name, gallery/venue, OR date cannot be confidently extracted, SKIP that entry.
- DO NOT set event_entry_id or entry_batch_id — leave them as empty strings "".
- Return a JSON object with key "entries" containing an array of ArtEntry objects.
- Be conservative: only extract events you are highly confident about.
